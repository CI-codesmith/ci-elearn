## 🎯 Objective
Learn the basics of deploying a machine learning model. Practice saving a trained model and writing simple instructions for how it could be used in production.

---

## 📋 Requirements

### Task 1: Save a Trained Model
- Train a simple model (e.g., Decision Tree or Linear Regression) on a small dataset
- Save the trained model using pickle or joblib

### Task 2: Write Deployment Instructions
- Write a markdown cell explaining how someone could use the saved model to make predictions
- List any requirements (Python version, libraries)

### Task 3: Discuss Real-World Use
- Write a markdown cell describing one real-world scenario where model deployment is important (e.g., predicting loan approval, spam detection)
