## 🎯 Objective
Learn how to use simple clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to group data and interpret clusters.

---

## 📋 Requirements

### Task 1: Load a Dataset
- Use pandas to load a small dataset suitable for clustering (e.g., Iris, Mall Customers, or any CSV)

### Task 2: Apply Clustering Algorithms
- Use Scikit-learn to perform K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering
- Show cluster assignments for each sample

### Task 3: Visualize Clusters
- Plot clusters in 2D using matplotlib
- Write a markdown cell explaining what the clusters represent
