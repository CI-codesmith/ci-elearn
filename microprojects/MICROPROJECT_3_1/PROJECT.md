## 📋 Requirements

### Task 1: Load a Dataset
- Use pandas to load a small dataset (e.g., Iris, Wine, or any CSV)
- Display column names and basic statistics

### Task 2: Identify Important Features
- Use a simple correlation analysis to find features most related to the target
- Use Scikit-learn's SelectKBest to identify top K features
- Show the selected features and their scores

### Task 3: Compare Model Performance
- Train a simple model (e.g., Decision Tree) using all features
- Train the same model using only selected features
- Compare accuracy and explain which is better
