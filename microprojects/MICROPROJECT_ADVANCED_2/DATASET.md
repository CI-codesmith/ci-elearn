# Dataset Information - MICROPROJECT ADVANCED 2

## Dataset Requirements

For this advanced project, use:
- **Image datasets** with 10,000+ samples
- **Complex datasets** requiring preprocessing
- **Open datasets** from Kaggle, UCI, or government sources

## Recommended Sources

1. **Kaggle** - kaggle.com/datasets
2. **CIFAR-10** - archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/
3. **ImageNet** - image-net.org
4. **Google Colab** - Built-in datasets

## Key Considerations
✅ Image quality and resolution
✅ Dataset size (10,000+ preferred)
✅ Number of classes (2-10 recommended)
✅ Real-world applicability

**Quality datasets are crucial for success.**
