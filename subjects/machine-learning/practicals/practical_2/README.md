## Learning Outcomes (Practical Level)

After completing this practical, students will be able to:

1. **Understand data quality issues** and their impact on ML models
2. **Implement data cleaning techniques** (handling missing values, outliers, duplicates)
3. **Perform data transformation** (normalization, standardization, encoding)
4. **Apply feature scaling and encoding techniques**
5. **Prepare datasets for ML algorithms**

---

## Practical Objective

Data preprocessing is a critical step in the machine learning pipeline. This practical teaches students how to:
- Identify and handle missing data
- Deal with categorical variables
- Scale and normalize features
- Detect and handle outliers
- Prepare datasets for model training

---

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Practical 1 (Installation)
- Basic knowledge of Python
- Understanding of Pandas and NumPy libraries

---

## Topics Covered

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Data types and structure
   - Summary statistics
   - Identifying missing values

2. **Handling Missing Data**
   - Methods: Drop, Mean/Median/Mode imputation
   - Forward/Backward fill for time series

3. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**
   - Statistical methods (IQR, Z-score)
   - Visual methods (box plots, scatter plots)

4. **Feature Scaling**
   - Normalization (Min-Max scaling)
   - Standardization (Z-score normalization)

5. **Encoding Categorical Variables**
   - Label encoding
   - One-hot encoding
   - Ordinal encoding

6. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creating new features
   - Feature selection techniques
