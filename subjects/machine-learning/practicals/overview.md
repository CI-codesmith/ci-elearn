# Practicals – Machine Learning

Practicals are guided, hands-on exercises designed to help learners
implement and experiment with Machine Learning concepts introduced
in theory units.

They focus on *doing* and *observing*, rather than open-ended exploration.

## Purpose of Practicals

- Translate theoretical concepts into executable steps
- Build familiarity with standard ML workflows
- Strengthen confidence in implementation
- Prepare learners for independent microprojects

---

## Role in the Course

Practicals are closely aligned with theory units and are typically
completed shortly after the corresponding unit.

They act as a bridge between lectures and applied projects.
