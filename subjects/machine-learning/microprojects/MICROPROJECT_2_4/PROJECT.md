# MICROPROJECT 2.5: Train-Test Split and Data Preparation (Beginner)

**Course:** 316316 - Machine Learning  
**Unit:** 2 (Data Preparation)  
**Duration:** 1 week  
**Submission:** Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) + CSV files + PDF Summary  
**Weight:** 8% of unit assessment

---

## 🎯 Objective
Learn how to split a dataset into training and testing sets. Understand why this is crucial for building reliable ML models.

---

## 📋 Requirements

### Task 1: Load and Prepare Data
- Use pandas to load a small dataset (e.g., Iris, Titanic, or any CSV)
- Clean the data (remove duplicates, handle missing values)

### Task 2: Train-Test Split
- Use Scikit-learn's train_test_split to split the data (e.g., 80% train, 20% test)
- Show the number of samples in each set
- Explain why splitting is important in a markdown cell

### Task 3: Save Split Data
- Save the train and test sets as separate CSV files

---

## 📤 Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook with code and markdown explanations
- Train and test CSV files
- Short PDF summary (1 page) describing your process

---

## 📝 Tips for Beginners
- Focus on simple, clear steps
- Use comments to explain your code
- Ask for help if you're unsure about any step

# MICROPROJECT 3.2: Feature Extraction with PCA (Beginner)

**Course:** 316316 - Machine Learning  
**Unit:** 3 (Feature Selection)  
**Group Size:** 3 students  
**Duration:** 1 week  
**Weight:** 8% of course assessment

---

## 🎯 Objective
Learn how to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract important features and reduce dimensionality in a dataset.

---

## 📋 Requirements

### Task 1: Load a Dataset
- Use pandas to load a small dataset (e.g., Iris, Wine, or any CSV)

### Task 2: Apply PCA
- Use Scikit-learn to perform PCA on the dataset
- Show how many components explain most of the variance
- Visualize the first two principal components in a scatter plot

### Task 3: Explain PCA
- Write a markdown cell explaining what PCA does and why it’s useful
