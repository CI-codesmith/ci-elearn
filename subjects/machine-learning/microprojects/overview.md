# Microprojects – Machine Learning

Microprojects are small, focused applied tasks designed to bridge the gap
between theoretical understanding and practical implementation in
Machine Learning.

They encourage exploration, experimentation, and interpretation rather
than large-scale system building.

---

## Purpose of Microprojects

- Reinforce concepts learned in units
- Encourage hands-on interaction with data
- Develop problem formulation skills
- Build confidence before larger projects

---

## Placement in the Course

Microprojects are introduced progressively as units advance.
Each microproject is mapped to one or more units and complements
lectures, practicals, and assessments.
