    "## Task 1: What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is a type of artificial intelligence where computers learn patterns from data, rather than being explicitly programmed with rules. Instead of telling a computer exactly what to do in every situation, we show it many examples and let it figure out the pattern. For instance, instead of coding rules for spam detection (like \"if email contains word 'free' then mark as spam\"), we can show a machine learning model thousands of examples of spam and non-spam emails, and it learns to recognize spam on its own."

    "### 2.1 Supervised Learning\n",
    "**Definition:** Learning from labeled data where we provide both inputs and correct answers. The model learns by comparing its predictions with the correct answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Email spam detection - we train a model with emails labeled as \"spam\" or \"not spam\", and it learns to classify new emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "**Definition:** Learning from unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or groups without being told what the \"correct\" answer is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Grouping customers by their shopping behavior - the algorithm finds natural groups without us telling it what the groups should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "**Definition:** Learning through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Game AI learning to play chess - it gets +1 point for winning, -1 for losing, and learns to make better moves."

    "### Application 1: Healthcare - Disease Detection\n",
    "Doctors use ML to detect diseases in medical images like X-rays and CT scans. The model is trained on thousands of labeled medical images (normal vs. disease) and learns to spot patterns indicating diseases. This helps radiologists work faster and catch diseases early.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application 2: Finance - Fraud Detection\n",
    "Banks use ML to detect fraudulent transactions. The model learns patterns of normal spending for each customer and flags suspicious transactions that don't match the pattern, protecting customers from fraud.\n",
