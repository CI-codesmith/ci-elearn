# MICROPROJECT 5.3: Ethics in Practice

**Course:** 316316 - Machine Learning  
**Unit:** 5 (Ethics, Production & Applications)  
**Group Size:** 3 students  
**Duration:** 1.5 weeks  
**Weight:** 10% of course assessment

---

## 👥 Group Roles
- **Data Engineer:** Data analysis and bias detection
- **ML Engineer:** Fairness metric implementation
- **Analyst:** Case study analysis and reporting

---

## 🎯 Objective
Analyze real-world case studies of machine learning ethics, focusing on bias, fairness, and responsible AI. Apply fairness metrics to a dataset and propose mitigation strategies.

---

## 📋 Requirements

### Case Study Selection
Choose **one** real-world case:
- **COMPAS Recidivism** (criminal justice bias)
- **Gender Shades** (facial recognition bias)
- **Credit Scoring** (financial fairness)

### Technical Requirements
- Analyze dataset for bias and fairness
- Implement fairness metrics (demographic parity, equal opportunity, disparate impact)
- Visualize and interpret fairness results
- Propose and test mitigation strategies (reweighting, preprocessing, etc.)

### Model Requirements
1. **Data Analysis** (explore, visualize bias)
2. **Fairness Metrics** (compute, interpret)
3. **Mitigation** (apply, evaluate)
4. **Case Study Report** (analysis, recommendations)
