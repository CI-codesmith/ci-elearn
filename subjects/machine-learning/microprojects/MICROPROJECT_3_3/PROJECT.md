## 📋 Requirements

### Task 1: Load a Dataset
- Use pandas to load a small dataset (e.g., Iris, Wine, or any CSV)
- Display all features and basic statistics

### Task 2: Identify Irrelevant Features
- Use variance threshold to find features with low variance
- Use correlation with target variable to identify low-correlation features
- List features that should be removed

### Task 3: Build Models and Compare
- Train a model using all features
- Train the same model after removing identified irrelevant features
- Compare performance and explain the results
