# MICROPROJECT 3.2: Correlation Analysis and Feature Relationships (Beginner)

**Course:** 316316 - Machine Learning  
**Unit:** 3 (Feature Selection)  
**Duration:** 1 week  
**Submission:** Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) + PDF Summary  
**Weight:** 8% of unit assessment

---

## 🎯 Objective
Explore relationships between features using correlation analysis. Learn to identify which features are most strongly related to the target variable.

---

## 📋 Requirements

### Task 1: Load and Explore Data
- Use pandas to load a small dataset (e.g., Boston Housing, Iris, or any CSV)
- Display column names and basic statistics

### Task 2: Calculate Correlations
- Use pandas to calculate correlation matrix for numerical features
- Display correlation with target variable (if applicable)
- Visualize correlations using a heatmap (matplotlib or seaborn)

### Task 3: Interpret Results
- Write a markdown cell explaining which features are most strongly correlated
- Describe what this means for feature selection

---

## 📤 Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook with code and markdown explanations
- Correlation heatmap visualization
- Short PDF summary (1 page) describing your findings

---

## 📝 Tips for Beginners
- Focus on simple, clear steps
- Use comments to explain your code
- Ask for help if you're unsure about any step
