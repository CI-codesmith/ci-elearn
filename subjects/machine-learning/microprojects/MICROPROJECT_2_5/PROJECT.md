# MICROPROJECT 2.6: Data Visualization Basics (Beginner)

**Course:** 316316 - Machine Learning  
**Unit:** 2 (Data Preparation)  
**Duration:** 1 week  
**Submission:** Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) + PDF Summary  
**Weight:** 8% of unit assessment

---

## 🎯 Objective
Learn to visualize datasets using matplotlib and pandas. Understand how visualizations help explore data and identify patterns.

---

## 📋 Requirements

### Task 1: Load and Explore Data
- Use pandas to load a small dataset (e.g., Iris, Wine, or any CSV)
- Display basic statistics (mean, std, min, max)

### Task 2: Create Basic Visualizations
- Plot a histogram for one numerical column
- Plot a scatter plot for two numerical columns
- Plot a bar chart for one categorical column

### Task 3: Interpret Visualizations
- Write a markdown cell explaining what each visualization shows
- Describe any patterns or insights you notice

---

## 📤 Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook with code and markdown explanations
- Screenshots of your visualizations
- Short PDF summary (1 page) describing your findings

---

## 📝 Tips for Beginners
- Focus on simple, clear plots
- Use comments to explain your code
- Ask for help if you're unsure about any step
- **Sections:** Baseline → Tuning → Tuned model → Comparison

# MICROPROJECT 3.3: Feature Importance with Tree-Based Models (Beginner)

**Course:** 316316 - Machine Learning  
**Unit:** 3 (Feature Selection)  
**Group Size:** 3 students  
**Duration:** 1 week  
**Weight:** 8% of course assessment

---

## 🎯 Objective
Learn how to use tree-based models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest) to find important features in a dataset.

---

## 📋 Requirements

### Task 1: Load a Dataset
- Use pandas to load a small dataset (e.g., Iris, Wine, or any CSV)

### Task 2: Train a Tree-Based Model
- Use Scikit-learn to train a Decision Tree or Random Forest on the dataset
- Show the feature importances from the model
- Visualize feature importances in a bar chart

### Task 3: Explain Feature Importance
- Write a markdown cell explaining what feature importance means and why it’s useful
