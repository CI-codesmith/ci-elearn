# Podcast Series: Introduction to Machine Learning

---

## Overview

This curated podcast series presents discussion-based explorations of
Machine Learning concepts, focusing on intuition, motivation, and
real-world reasoning rather than formal algorithms or mathematics.

The series is intended to complement formal instruction by helping learners
develop strong mental models before engaging with equations and code.
