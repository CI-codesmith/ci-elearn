# Unit 1: What is Machine Learning?

---

## Unit Overview

This unit introduces the concept of Machine Learning, its motivation, and its
distinction from traditional rule-based programming. The unit establishes
the foundational vocabulary and intuition required for all subsequent units.

---

## Learning Objectives

After completing this unit, learners will be able to:

- Define Machine Learning and explain its core objective
- Distinguish between traditional programming and learning-based systems
- Identify major categories of Machine Learning
- Recognise real-world applications of Machine Learning
