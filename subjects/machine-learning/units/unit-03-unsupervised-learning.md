# Unit 3: Unsupervised Learning

---

## Unit Overview

This unit explores unsupervised learning techniques used to discover
patterns and structure in unlabelled data.

---

## Learning Objectives

After completing this unit, learners will be able to:

- Understand learning without labelled outputs
- Explain clustering and representation learning concepts
- Interpret patterns discovered in data

---

## Learning Components

This unit includes:

- Lecture notes and presentations
- Practicals focused on pattern discovery
- Microprojects:
  - [Microproject 3.1: Clustering Algorithms](../microprojects/MICROPROJECT_3_1.md)
