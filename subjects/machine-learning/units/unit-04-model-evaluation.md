# Unit 4: Model Evaluation and Improvement

---

## Unit Overview

This unit focuses on evaluating Machine Learning models and improving
their performance using systematic techniques.

---

## Learning Objectives

After completing this unit, learners will be able to:

- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics
- Understand bias, variance, and overfitting
- Apply methods for model improvement

---
